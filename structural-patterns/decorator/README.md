In the Decorator pattern, a class will add functionality to another class, without changing the other classes' structure.<br> 

In this example, the Book class will have it's title shown in different ways by the BookTitleDecorator and it's child classes BookTitleExclaimDecorator and BookTitleStarDecorator.<br> 

In my example I do this by having BookTitleDecorator make a copy of Book's title value, which is then changed for display. Depending on the implementation, it might be better to actually change the original object.<br>
