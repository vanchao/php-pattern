In the Prototype Pattern we create one standard object for each class, and clone that object to create new instances.<br> 

In this example we have an abstract BookPrototype class, with two specific or concrete subclasses, PHPBookPrototype and SQLBookPrototype. To create a object using either PHPBookPrototype or SQLBookPrototype we call the clone method.<br>
