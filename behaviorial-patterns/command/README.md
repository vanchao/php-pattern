In the Command Pattern an object encapsulates everything needed to execute a method in another object.<br>

In this example, a BookStarsOnCommand object is instantiated with an instance of the BookComandee class. The BookStarsOnCommand object will call that BookComandee object's bookStarsOn() function when it's execute() function is called.<br>
