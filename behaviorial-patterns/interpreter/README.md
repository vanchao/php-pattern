In the interpreter pattern you define a language, parse requests in that language, and assign the appropriate class(es), method(s), etc to handle each request.<br> 

In this example, the Interpreter class can handle strings in the following formats: "book author #", "book title #", or "book author title #". The # must be a numeric which must correlate to a book in the list of books we have.<br>
